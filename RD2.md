Objective:
I was supposed to get practice with using dictionaries, following problem-solving techniques, creating functions, and doing file I/O while converting a message in morse code from one file to plain english in an outputted file.
----------
Procedure:
First we made sure we understood the read me file entirely, and then we worked on our algorithm together using iterative development and testing each part before moving to the next. The key concepts we explored were iterative devlopment and file input and output.

-----------
Results:
Our results matched what we expected to get but only after a lot of problem solving and testing. We used many test case for every part of our program, including the error checking, and used extreme test cases.
-----------
Reflection:
The main challenge we encountered was making sure that our translation was output to a new file and that it was outputted correctly. It took a lot of testing to make sure that the entire file would be converted instead of just the last word of it, and to make sure that there was a correct amount of spacing between each character and word. We used iterative development, testing, and planning before we did our code. We overcame our challenges, but it took a lot of work, and really looking closely at the code to make sure we understood each part. I think I learned what I was supposed to for this lab. It was great working with Megan and I think we worked well together.
