It was a challenge for me to start because I didnt know where to start. It was hard for me to figure out the right steps or course of action. Therefore I took breaks while making the lab so that I could start with a fresh mind. I followed the three rules of coding by first thinking about the problem
to make a program that converses ciphers to plain English. For the second rule "Human readable essay" I made sure the code was understandable for everyone to read. And lastly for the third rule practice is key I practised a lot so that I could make it a little better each time. I think I learned what I was supposed to for this project as I learned a lot of new things such as how to do the functions and to use more meaningfull naming. Working with Laure also went good, we both did our parts so it workked out. Thus in conclusion I learnt a lot, the teamwork was good and helpful. I have improved my coding skills and I am starting to understand what I am coding and why.
